    <SCG.Paragraph>
      Hello, my name is Damien. I'm 34 years old. My family and I live in
      Tokyo.  I also used to live in Australia and in France where I am from. I
      have been a Fullstack engineer in a Japanese startup for two years now. 
      In my free time, I enjoy coding and learning new technologies. I also like
      spending time at the jiujitsu club and playing with my kids. In a near
      future I would like learn surfing and start working on an open source
      project.
