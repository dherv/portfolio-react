    "text": "Japan Railway, who is our end client, presented the project during a tech event last November. The system is composed of an admin website, an IOS application, and a display website. On the admin website, a user can configure the maps, their destinations, paths, and beacons. With the IOS application, users can load the maps, select a destination, and follow instructions to get there. After selecting a destination, each user gets a personal icon so they can be directed throughout the station by looking at the displays instead of their phone. The system uses beacon technology to calculate a smartphone's position. The IOS application communicates with the display through WebSockets. New features are currently being added: a voice helper that uses AWS Polly and a video player on the displays.",
